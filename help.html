		<h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>A) HTML Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>This theme contains: index.html and folder named "pages" that contains other pages. 
			<ol class="alpha">
				<li>index.html</li>
				index.html includes two section. First section with a class of "intro" contains: </br>
				* navigation in a div with a class "nav". </br>
				Div "nav" contains also two dives with class "lan", you can customize flags and make website bilingual. they contain flag which you can change. </br>
			* div with a class "info" that contains header of your website.
			</ol>
			
			
		<p>If you would like to edit the color, font, or style of any elements in one of these columns, you would do the following:</p>

<pre>	#primaryContent a {
		color: #someColor;
	} 
</pre>

		<p>If you find that your new style is not overriding, it is most likely because of a specificity problem. Scroll down in your CSS file and make sure that there isn't a similar style that has more weight.</p>

		<p>I.E.</p>

<pre>	#wrap #primaryContent a {
		color: #someColor;
	}
</pre>

		<p>So, to ensure that your new styles are applied, make sure that they carry enough "weight" and that there isn't a style lower in the CSS file that is being applied after yours.</p>

		<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>B) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>I'm using two CSS files in this theme. The first one is a generic reset file. Many browser interpret the default behavior of html elements differently. By using a general reset CSS file, we can work round this. This file also contains some general styling, such as anchor tag colors, font-sizes, etc. Keep in mind, that these values might be overridden somewhere else in the file.</p> 

		<p>The second file contains all of the specific stylings for the page. The file is separated into sections using:</p>  

<pre>	/* === Header Section === */

	some code

	/* === Main Section === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === Sidebar Section === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === Footer === */
	
	some code
	
	etc, etc. 
</pre>
		
		<p>If you would like to edit a specific section of the site, simply find the appropriate label in the CSS file, and then scroll down until you find the appropriate style that needs to be edited.</p> 

		<p>Any images that are placed within the blog section have 5px worth of padding and a light bluish background. If you would like to edit the display of these images, find the following section in the style sheet:</p>

<pre>	#primaryContent #blog img {
		change styles here:
	}
</pre>

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="javascript"><strong>C) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>This theme imports Javascript files.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>AngularJS</li>
			<li>My custom script</li>
			<li>CookieAlert script</li>
		</ol>
		  
		<ol>
			<li>In addition to the custom scripts, I implement a few "tried and true" plugins to create the effects. This plugin is packed, so you won't need to manually edit anything in the file. The only necessary thing to know is how to call the method. For example:
<pre>	[some Javascript goes here...along with an general explanation]</pre>
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="credits"><strong>E) Sources and Credits</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>I've used the following images, icons or other files as listed.
		
		<ul>
			<li>File name from file author</li>
			<li>File name from file author</li>
			<li>File name from file author</li>
			<li>File name from file author</li>
		</ul>
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>Once again, thank you so much for purchasing this theme. As I said at the beginning, I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this theme. No guarantees, but I'll do my best to assist. If you have a more general question relating to the themes on ThemeForest, you might consider visiting the forums and asking your question in the "Item Discussion" section.</p>
